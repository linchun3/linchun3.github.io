It’s not all that surprising because who would want to talk about a boring topic or a practice that is does not exist at their workplace?
I like to broach the topic of testing because it gives me a glimpse into how different engineering teams perceive testingand how much they value their engineering craft.
Some engineers test their code, even if they do not explicitly write tests.</description></item></channel></rss>
