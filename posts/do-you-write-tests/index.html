<p>My conversations among peers in the engineering field rarely touch upon testing.</p>
<p>It’s not all that surprising because who would want to talk about a boring topic or a practice that is does not exist at their workplace?</p>
<p>I like to broach the topic of testing because it gives me a glimpse into how different engineering teams perceive testingand how much they value their engineering craft.</p>
<p>Some engineers test their code, even if they do not explicitly write tests. They often find writing tests tedious and that they do not provide additional value to their feature.</p>
<p>I concede that writing tests can be tedious, but it is definitely not useless.</p>
<p>Without writing tests, how would you know that newly introduced change does not break your existing code? Without writing tests, how would you be sure that you’ve tested a wide range of edge cases?</p>
<p>Some engineers also argue that testing, in particular [unit testing is useless](Unit Testing is Overrated | Alexey Golub (<a href=https://tyrrrz.me/blog/unit-testing-is-overrated>https://tyrrrz.me/blog/unit-testing-is-overrated</a>)) and contributes zero value to development.</p>
<p>I strongly disagree.</p>
<p>My opinion is that if you find unit testing useless, then you’re probably not doing it right. There could be many reasons, one of which is that unit testing can be difficult as a purist insists that each dependency has to be abstracted away. The definition of unit testing can be subjective because the term unit itself is subjective. I treat a unit as a logical segment of code that does one thing, in this case if I perform functional programming, then a unit is a function.</p>
<p>In my career, I’ve been to places where written tests were non-existent, whenever I had to push code, there would always be this looming fear of your code breaking in production and having to debug and fix it on the fly.</p>
<p>At my current workplace, we have automated testing in place and a culture to write(and fix) tests for every piece of code written. It has helped me to feel more confident of introducing changes and through the process of fixing code to pass tests, it has helped me to write better code.</p>
<p>I was greatly influenced by this <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-Practical-Guide/dp/0131016490>TDD book</a> on writing tests. What I enjoyed most was the walkthrough of &ldquo;red, green, refactor&rdquo; with a singular example throughout the book.</p>
<p>Maybe, a few years down the road I might form a different opinion on testing. Who knows?</p>
