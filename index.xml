Dynamic typing(Duck typing in particular) is one of the main reasons why python is so popular today. The learning curve for python much lower than static-typed languages like C and Java, because there is less &amp;ldquo;boiler-plate&amp;rdquo; involved in writing code.
Having experienced both static and dynamic typed languages, I have come to appreciate the assurances provided by static typed languages, which has improved my development experience.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://linchun3.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Sep 2021 21:37:58 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://linchun3.github.io/about/</guid><description>Hey, I&amp;rsquo;m linchun and I enjoy engineering.

Fast forward to today, I version control all of my projects (dotfiles, blogs, school work, tutorials etc&amp;hellip;) and I&amp;rsquo;m no longer afraid to work through merge conflicts and rebases.
It all started with me trying to understand more about git, through Git Pro. It is a book filled with insights and probably the most underrated book I&amp;rsquo;ve ever read thus far.</description></item><item><title>first post</title><link>https://linchun3.github.io/posts/first-post/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Sep 2021 01:31:31 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://linchun3.github.io/posts/first-post/</guid><description>Hey,
This is the first post of my humble blog.
Somewhere along this year, I decided I wanted to write more. Writing helps to improve communication skills, which I needed work on.
After some months of procrastination, I stumbled upon this blogpost and decided to get started on it.
Stay tuned for content on engineering, and maybe some slice-of-life.</description></item></channel></rss>
